### About me:
Automated of routine tasks using programming (JS, Python) while working as a purchasing specialist. I continue to engage in self-education, developing in the direction of frontend development. I am always ready for a constructive dialogue.  

In addition to the main work that was conducted on the company's own website, I used my skills and made the following scripts:
- Cross-number collectors on the Emex and Exist sites, as well as small changes in the Emex UI to display the necessary information, Exist was implemented on Promise.
- Smart substitution of the product quantity in the invoice based on the marked items.
- Interaction with the external 4tochki API and updating catalog items.
- Price parser and auto search for the list of articles for the site AutoTO.

In 2020, I completed the Frontend Technology development course at the training center WorldSkills.
